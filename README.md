# Mitron-Credit-Card-Analysis
Mitron Bank, a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad, plans to introduce a new line of credit cards. I analyzed a dataset of 4,000 customers to understand behaviors, preferences, and spending patterns. The insights, delivered through a Power BI report, guided the development of targeted credit card strategies, focusing on clients aged 25-45 and key spending categories. This project aims to boost card usage and enhance Mitron Bank's market reach.

The goal is to expand their product offerings and enhance their market reach. To achieve this, they seek to understand customer behaviors, preferences, and spending patterns to design credit cards that meet customer needs and market trends.
